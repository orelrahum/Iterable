# Iterable

wrote by : Orel Rahum and Naomi Oyer


This project represent iterable class.

We build 5 containers:

range :
Used as a more readable equivalent to the traditional for loop operating over a range of values, such as all elements in a container.

chain :
represent combining between 2 containers (include string).

zip :
represent parallel connection between 2 containers.

product :
represent Cartesian product between 2 containers.

powerset :
represent all the sub-groups of container.

what is iterable?
allows an object to be the target of the "foreach" statement.
